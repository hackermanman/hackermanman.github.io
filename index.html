        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Crack the eggs into a medium bowl and season with a very generous pinch of salt and several grinds of black pepper.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Add cream, and beat the eggs with a fork until they are a uniform light yellow color. 
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Meanwhile, melt the butter in a small non-stick pan over high heat.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> When the butter melts and begins to foam, pour in the eggs and immediately turn to low. Stir with a spoon or spatula constantly as you cook
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> When the eggs are just set but still look too moist, remove them to a plate (they will continue to cook a bit as they rest).
